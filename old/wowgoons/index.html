<p><i>"In World of Warcraft, <b>the legendary Goons of the Mal'ganis server</b> had figured out a way to slay the revered nonplayer character that rules their in-game faction - an achievement tantamount to killing your own team mascot."</i> -<a href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/16-02/mf_goons?currentPage=all">Wired</a></p>

<h2>Why bother with any other guild?</h2> 
 
<p>&lt;Goon Squad&gt; is by and large <b>THE</b> best guild on Mal'Ganis, if not all of World of Warcraft. We achieved "World First - Level 25 Guild" and we're over 4000 <i>accounts</i> strong, with many members having multiple level 90 characters. Within the guild we have countless crafters with every available tradeskill and even the rarest recipes. &lt;Goon Squad&gt; has multiple raiding teams for all levels of content farming each and every boss and their hard mode in Pandaria.</p> 
 
<p>Aside from all the above benefits, &lt;Goon Squad&gt; also has a massive Ventrilo server, eight tab guild bank fully stocked with flasks, potions, elixirs, enchanting materials, over 800,000g for repairs, and the best Mists of Pandraia raiding consumables freely available for every <span class="gold">GOLD</span> level and above member. We also have an extensive DKP system which has been running for nine years strong, several hundred mule WoW accounts containg rare and powerful tradable battle pets, and a massively active forums system.</p> 

<p>During the Wrath of the Lich King Beta many of &lt;Goon Squad&gt;'s members were selected. This gave &lt;Goon Squad&gt; an in-depth look into the World of Warcraft expansion before even MMO-Champion or WoWInsider reported on it. Currently, with Patch 5.4, &lt;Goon Squad&gt; has blown through every boss in Siege of Orgrimmar and their subsequent hard modes. (Videos of hard mode Garrosh Hellscream will be uploaded and released for the public when other guilds have had an opportunity to defeat the encounter.)</p>

<h2>How to join!</h2> 

<p>First and foremost, you need to select your desired membership level-</p> 
 
<h4 class="bronze">Bronze Membership</h4> 
<p>&lt;Goon Squad&gt;'s most basic membership. Along with a guild invite, <span class="bronze">BRONZE</span> members get access to &lt;Goon Squad&gt;'s vast pool of crafters, Ventrilo server, and forums. <span class="bronze">BRONZE</span> members also may do only the Heart of Fear, Mogu'shan Vaults, Terrace of Endless Spring, and Throne of Thunder Mists of Pandria 10 man instances, but are capped at saving no more than 250 DKP at any given time. Tier tokens are only purchasable with a premium bonus of just $4.95.</p> 
 
<h4 class="silver">Silver Membership</h4> 
<p>Along with all the benefits of <span class="bronze">BRONZE</span> membership, <span class="silver">SILVER</span> members are able to raid with &lt;Goon Squad&gt;'s 5.0 and 5.2 patch 25 man raids. <span class="silver">SILVER</span> members have their maximum DKP limit raised to 500. Upgrading to this membership level also allows members to gain Tier 14 and Tier 15 tokens and participate in &lt;Goon Squad&gt; pre-made honor farming battleground groups. <span class="silver">SILVER</span> members also are granted protection from 'Timeless Guile Goons', an elite task force of guild members equipped with <a href="http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=102467" rel="item=102467">Censure of Eternal Agony</a> sworn only to crush any player character on the new 5.4 Timeless Isle.</p> 
 
<h4 class="gold">Gold Membership</h4> 
<p>As well as all the previously listed membership benefits, <span class="gold">GOLD</span> members are given priority for Tier 14 and 15 tokens.
