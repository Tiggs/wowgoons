Through the game World of Warcraft, guilds are created through either players finding similar interests or from preexisting
communtities. Goon Squad is a guild that is of the latter, formed from the Something Awful internet community.

The Something Awful community is largely renowned for having a paywall to act as a deterrent and to place a value on your
account access. This is to keep the forums "generally" clean. The act of "paying to get in" is language that has carried over
to the Goon Squad guild, as many players in World of Warcraft not in guild believe the guild requires to pay to get in. 

This is true in a sense, as access to Goon Squad requires a subscription to Something Awful, but not true in the sense that 
you can obtain access by simply paying to get in. This misinformation has persisted through nearly the 10 years World of
Warcraft has existed, and is perpetuated by intentional misdirection from players both in and outside of Goon Squad. 

Wowgoons.com is an extension of this joke. Originally written by Hodapp, the page has gone through several additions of
content based on World of Warcraft expansions and time based context. 

This project is designed to maintain the site.

It must be repeated, that both this site (wowgoons.com) and Goon Squad itself does not participate in the activity 
of scamming or accepting players or people's money or goods and services in any form or fashion. It's merely a joke.
